#Restaurant - API

This is an API I built in order to practice developing an API that could work to solve a real world solution. The ERD is a little bit out of date as I have not had the time to make a new implementation. I will be building out the front end application soon.

# This README file is currently under construction. While the app is mostly done I have not had time yet to write appropriate docs.
## I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
